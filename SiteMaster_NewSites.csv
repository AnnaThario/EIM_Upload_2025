Sampled 1 large riffle downstream (ds) of a large log spanning the creek.

2023
Sampled two riffles.
Lower flow compared to previous sampling pictures.
Bushwacked down to stream from parking spot.
Left some flagging, but ran out halfway.

2022
Sampled 2 riffles.
Potential washout removed last year's temp log & several large logs from 2021 photos.
Last transect (U/S) has uncertain BFW due to inaccessible bank & BFD with faint laser pointer.

2021
Sampled 3 riffles.
Top of reach has orange flagging.
Flow much lower than photos from 2020.
Received complaint about parking in turnout near blue gate - but Jenee clarified that we had permission to be on that road.

2020
Sampled 3 riffles - same area as last year.
Walked in water along the RB from entry point to get to bottom of reach.

2019
Trail hard to see from DNR road.
Added additional orange flagging at entry point on right side of road.
Trail overgrown.
Follow orange flagging to old decommissioned road and blue flagging to stream.
Flagging at large cedar on R/B marks entry to stream.
Sampled D/S of confluence and right at entry near cedar tree.
3 riffles.

2018
Follow map of road until you see orange flagging on the right side.
(The bridge means you drove too far).
Follow orange flagging down slope until you reach blue flagging at the old decommissioned road.
Continue following blue flagging until you reach below the confluence.
Access stream by large, flagged cedar on stream bank.
Sampled 4 riffles.

2017
Sampled 4 riffles.
We tried one of the trails illustrated on the map as described, but had to bushwhack most of the way down until a decommissioned road.
Eventually found the trail along Margaret Ck and walked D/S to confluence (big pool and LWD across), and then just D/S past to riffles.
On our way back, we tried continuing up the decommissioned road, which eventually led us to a trail (possibly crossing private property) back to the road we parked on.

Follow this road for about 2.5 miles until you reach the Logging Bypass gate on the left, it is a distinct left turn onto a more gravel-y road (the gate was left open in 2018, but normally use the $500 key to open it). Follow the map using the outlined yellow line and refer to LNT Info Sheet until you reach site (see photo below). \\ From the Carnation-Duvall Rd (SR 203), take the Kelly Rd gate (North Fork Rd, check key) and follow �logging truck� bypass (gravel-y road) to the left. This left turn is before a gated gorge bridge to Seattle City Light land, if you get to this bridge you have gone too far. Take the bypass (highlighted) near Yellow Creek to go around the closed road (2016). Turning off onto NFD 6250 you can bushwack down on the second stream crossing. Or take a right onto NF-6200-3. You�ll cross over the North Fork Tolt River bridge, park and go down the steep rocks to the river and head downriver to the site as described in route 2 below. Stop in Redmond/Carnation for food/bathrooms. 2) Access from Highway 2 to Goldbar: past Zeke�s Drive-in (type this into google maps) and after a big bend you turn right onto NF road 6200. You will reach the first gate (use $500 key), continue driving following the map, and you�ll reach a Y, keep right. Then you�ll reach a T, turn left, then you�ll reach another Gate (Proctor Cr., same key), you�ll be on 62001 and and you reach another Y, stay right. Take right again (at the T), then there will be a straight stretch, continue and you�ll turn right (don�t continue straight). Continue until you reach the end of the road with straw/hay hill. You may pass piping on the side of the road along the way close to the site. (Most direct route). 2016 Description: First Gate � do not enter (if open) without checking to see if key works!

We started with LNT075179 before coming back US to this site. 2021: Drove to Kelley Gate (coordinates below). Then drove ~4 miles on road and then turned left at 'Logging  Trucks Bypass' sign. If gate is closed, Campbell Global key works. After this, we used offline Google Maps to guide us to the site. (load the coordinates before going into Kelley Gate). When driving back to Kelley Gate, you might not be able to use offline Google Maps because the roads might not load. Either use GPS or rely on maps. Some service returns ~15 minutes after driving back. Took ~15 minutes to hike to site from parking spot.

Refer to site sheet screenshots to plan route. To get to the main gate on Kelly Rd, go through Carnation north on highway 203, then turn right on to NE Stillwater Rd, which veers North and turns into Kelly Rd NE. Just after NE 127th St, there is a gravel road on the right.  Turn up onto this and use the Campbell Global key to go through the gate.  Alternate access instructions:  From Carnation, take right onto NE Stillwater Rd/Kelly Rd NE. Turn right on NE North Fork Rd, which is gated. After passing gated/fenced facility and ponds on right side, take a sharp left at �Logging Trucks Turn� sign. Follow maps below. Park at junction of main road and dirt/overgrown road (indicated on maps).
There are two routes to this site (and 07LNT075179), use Googlemaps to navigate to the starting point rather than the site, you will soon lose reception so follow maps closely after at starting points: 1) Access from Carnation Duvall Road / Kelly Road and Gate: (GPS coordinates of Kelly Gate: 47.713446,-121.893320). Once through Kelly Gate (2021: Cambell Golbal key works. SPU may have to open this gate for you, we weren�t able to test the $500 key, someone let us in from SPU in 2017). Follow this road for about 4 miles until you reach the Bypass gate on the left � use the $500 key for this. Follow the map using the outlined yellow line and refer to LNT Info Sheet until you reach site (see photo below). You will reach a �T� once close to site. You can enter this site either by continuing walking D/S past 07LNT075179 to site, or instead of turning right at the T, you turn left and once you reach the bridge (North Tolt River Bridge), cross over and park and go down the steep rocks to the river and head downriver to the site, trying not to enter the water. The second way was done in 2017 and is recommended. 2016 Notes: From the Carnation-Duvall Rd (SR 203), take the Kelly Rd gate (North Fork Rd, check key) and follow �logging truck� bypass to the left before gated gorge bridge to Seattle City Light. If possible, take the bypass (highlighted) near Yellow Creek to go around the closed road (2016). Take a right onto NF-6200-3. You�ll cross over the North Fork Tolt River bridge, park and go down the steep rocks to the river and head downriver to the site, trying not to enter the water. Stop in Redmond/Carnation for food/bathrooms. 2) Access from Highway 2 to Goldbar: past Zeke�s Drive-in (type this into google maps) and after a big bend you turn right onto NF road 6200. You will reach the first gate (use $500 key), continue driving following the map, and you�ll reach a Y, keep right. Then you�ll reach a T, turn left, then you�ll reach another Gate (Proctor Cr., same key), you�ll be on 62001 and you reach another Y, stay right. Take right again (at the T), then there will be a straight stretch- you can turn right and park where you would park for 07LNT075179, or you can go straight and cross over the bridge (North Tolt River Bridge). Park and go down the steep rocks to the river and head downriver to the site, trying not to enter the water. The second way was done in 2017 and is recommended. 2016 Notes: Most direct � Highway 2 to Goldbar, past Zeke�s Drive-in and big bend to NF road 6200 on right. Gate � do not enter (if open) without checking to see if key works! First Y take the right, then left, there will be another gate (Proctor Cr., check key) and you�ll be on 62001 then right and right, there will be a straight stretch, at the T take a right onto NF-6200-3. You�ll cross over the North Fork Tolt River bridge, park and go down the steep rocks to the river and head downriver to the site, trying not to enter the water. Possible to find second trib mouth for 07LNT075179 from river, but difficult. ~400 m DS of this site, US of big cedar and left bend in the river.
